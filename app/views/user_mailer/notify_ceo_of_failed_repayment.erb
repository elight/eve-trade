<%= @bond_holder %> purchased <%= @num_shares %> of <%= @bond_symbol %> from you on <%= @shares_bought_at %>.

These bonds matured on and were due for repayment on <%= @bonds_matured_at %> .  However, your balance of <%= number_with_delimiter @balance, :delimiter => "," %> ISK was inadequate to repay their value of <%= number_with_delimiter @bond_value, :delimiter => "," %> ISK.

<%= @bond_holder %> has also been notified of this failed repayment.

Sincerely,
The EVE Trade board
